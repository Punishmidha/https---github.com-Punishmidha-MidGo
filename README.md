## Project Overview
**MidGo** is a full-stack web application designed for seamless property rental services. The platform allows users to create, browse, and book property listings. Property owners can easily manage their listings, while users can review and interact with listings securely. **MidGo** focuses on delivering essential features for property management, authentication, and bookings without integrating maps.

Built using **MongoDB**, **Express.js**, **Node.js**, and **EJS**, this application ensures a fast, scalable, and secure system for both users and property owners.
